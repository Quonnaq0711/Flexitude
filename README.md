# Flexitude - Flask React Project

## Full Stack React, Redux, Flask, Alembic, SQLite3/PostgresQL App

### Introduction

This is a full-stack solo project built using React, Redux, Flask, Alembic, and SQLite3/PostgreSQL. This application features user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, log out, and use a demo user login button for easy access. The app also includes three major CRUD features:

1. **Exercise**
2. **Workouts**
3. **Events**

The front-end is built with React, Redux (with normalized data), and CSS, while the back-end is powered by Flask, Alembic, and SQLite3/PostgreSQL for data storage.
